title: "Mitochondrial Genome Analysis of Black Bengal Goat"
excerpt: "The Black Bengal goat (BBG) is a highly valued goat breed in Bangladesh known for its unique traits, such as disease resistance, high prolificacy rate, and low food demand due to its dwarf size. This study investigated the mitochondrial genome of BBG to gain insights into its origin, molecular evolution, and energy metabolism. Genomic DNA was extracted from healthy BBG samples, and the mitochondrial genome was assembled and annotated. The complete mitogenome of BBG was found to be 16,640 bp in length, containing protein-coding genes, rRNA genes, tRNA genes, and a control region. The analysis revealed an A+T bias and a close genetic relationship with the Malaysian goat breed. The findings contribute to taxonomic classification, phylogenetic reconstruction, and conservation strategies for this valuable goat breed.
