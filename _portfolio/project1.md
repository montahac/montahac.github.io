title: "The genome assembly of the Black Bengal goat (Capra hircus)"
excerpt: "This study presents the genomic analysis of a healthy male Black Bengal goat from Chattogram, Bangladesh. Using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, the genome was sequenced and assembled, resulting in a 3.04 Gb genome with 82.5% completeness. The annotation identified 26,458 gene models and 31.85% repeat elements. Gene ontology analysis linked 12,589 GO terms to 8,173 genes. The genomic data is available in NCBI GenBank, offering valuable insights for future research and breeding programs.

This is an item in your portfolio. It can have images or nice text. If you name the file .md, it will be parsed as markdown. If you name the file .html, it will be parsed as HTML. 

<br><br>

To ensure consistent spacing after each paragraph, you can also use the CSS method if supported by your Markdown renderer:

<style>
p {
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Adjust the value to the desired space */
}
</style>

This will automatically add space after every paragraph without needing to manually insert <br> tags or blank lines.
