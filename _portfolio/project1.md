title: "The genome assembly of the Black Bengal goat (Capra hircus)"
excerpt: "This study presents the genomic analysis of a healthy male Black Bengal goat from Chattogram, Bangladesh. Using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, the genome was sequenced and assembled, resulting in a 3.04 Gb genome with 82.5% completeness. The annotation identified 26,458 gene models and 31.85% repeat elements. Gene ontology analysis linked 12,589 GO terms to 8,173 genes. The genomic data is available in NCBI GenBank, offering valuable insights for future research and breeding programs.
