##  üéâ üéâ Welcome Visitor!  üéâ üéâ

This is to share my academic progress, achievements, and ongoing projects in the field of bioinformatics. This platform serves as a portfolio where you can explore my publications, GitHub repositories, and various research endeavors.

## **Mission** üèÅ
The primary mission of this website is to provide a transparent and detailed account of my academic journey. I aim to connect with bioinformaticians, academics, and professors who share my enthusiasm for solving complex biological problems through innovative research. 

## **Background** ü§ù
I graduated with a BSc in _Bioinformatics_ (Asian University for Women), following which I completed my MSc in _Cancer Immunology & Biotechnology_ (University of Nottingham). Following graduation, I worked as a Genomics Diagnostic Scientist at [SourceBioscience
](https://sourcebioscience.com/genomics-services-and-covid-19/), where I helped test over 250 samples a day for COVID-19. I later joined the [COVID-19 Surveillance Team](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey) at Wellcome Centre for Humana Genetics at University of Oxford, a collaboration with[ Office of National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases). I later joined as an RA at [Siebold Group](https://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/research/professor-christian-siebold), Divison of STRUBI at Oxford. You can learn more about my academic research under my projects section. 

Simultaneously, I am training as a Data Scientist 

I am eager to leverage my bioinformatics expertise to address and overcome the biological and computational challenges faced in both clinical and academic settings in Bangladesh. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of these fields through innovative research and practical applications, ultimately enhancing healthcare and scientific knowledge in my home country.

**Research Interests:** üß¨üß¨

- _Transcriptomic Analysis:_ Investigating gene expression patterns to understand biological processes and disease mechanisms.
  
- _Multiomics:_ Integrating data from various omics layers (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to gain a holistic view of biological systems.

- _Innovative Research Methodologies:_ Utilizing cutting-edge techniques and tools to push the boundaries of bioinformatics research.
  
- _Machine Learning:_ Developing ML algorithms in developing computational tools.
  
## **Learning Skills (Ongoing)** üî¨
My core values are deeply rooted in my approach to research and personal growth:

Programming Languages
‚Ä£ R, Bash, Python, Perl

Tools & Softwares
‚Ä£ GATK, bcftools, samtools, RShiny, BBMap, Bioconductor, NextFlow, and Docker.

Machine Leaning:
‚Ä£ PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy

## **Fun Facts About Me** üî•

- Creative Writer: I write poetry, short stories, or even have a blog where you share your thoughts and experiences.
  
- Chef at Heart: I love cooking and have mastered several complex recipes, often hosting dinner parties for friends.

- Collector: I collect something unusual, like vintage postcards, stamps, or even quirky socks.

- Adventurous Eater: I love trying out exotic foods from different cultures and have a goal to taste a dish from every country.
